Keywords:
machine learning, statistics, social network analysis, data visualization, malware detection and analysis methods. 

The aim is to learn how to:

    Analyze malware using static analysis
    Observe malware behavior using dynamic analysis
    Identify adversary groups through shared code analysis
    Catch 0-day vulnerabilities by building your own machine learning detector
    Measure malware detector accuracy
    Identify malware campaigns, trends, and relationships through data visualization

I'll be using VirtualBox 5.2.18 or later version for my Ubuntu Virtual Machine as well as the code and data that accompany the book from this link: https://www.malwaredatascience.com/ubuntu-virtual-machine
